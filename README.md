# SciSight
[SciSight](https://www.scisight.earth) is an innovative platform developed during the [NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2023](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/) that dynamically aggregates scientific information from government agencies, providing users with a highly accurate research experience and simplifying open science data for everyone. Its search algorithm delivers personalized and specific information to users on their topic of interest. This unique approach simplifies access to and comprehension of dense information related to social and ecological knowledge, making data retrieval more efficient and democratic through [machine learning](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [natural language processing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), and other specific algorithms. Check out SciSight architecture bellow or the [full article](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/find-a-team/scisight/?tab=project) for more details.

## About
### Importance
Access to information is a fundamental right, but the complex language of scientific information makes access difficult, which deprives many of their rights. The democratization of information makes it more accessible to less privileged social strata.

### The problem
In the information age, people want answers fast, but often don't know where to find essential information, delaying projects and research. This results in gaps in society and vulnerable communities, leading to problems such as stereotypes, fake news and environmental injustices.

### The solution
SciSight is a platform that simplifies access to scientific information using machine learning and natural language processing. It offers clear and didactic answers, regardless of the user's knowledge, encouraging action on socio-ecological issues for the benefit of society.

### Methodology
SciSight's methodology involves collecting data from government agencies, an intelligent search algorithm that classifies information based on specificity, clear and didactic communication, and guidance for action on socio-ecological issues according to a given search.

### Conclusion
SciSight plays a crucial role in promoting equal access to scientific information, tackling barriers such as technical language and lack of internet access. It empowers people to understand and act on scientific issues, contributing to a democratic society and a more equal and sustainable future.
